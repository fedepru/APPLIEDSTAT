# The ARMD data arise from a randomized multi-center clinical trial 
# comparing an experimental treatment (interferon-alpha) versus placebo 
# for patients diagnosed with ARMD. Patients with ARMD progressively lose vision.
# The dataset contains information about 234 subjects, for which the visual level is measured up to 4 times.
# We are mainly interested in the effect of treatment on the visual acuity measurements.

## The ARMD0 dataset contains the same information, but with an extra row for each patient relative 
## to the measurement at time 0. ARMD0 contains 240 subjects.

### 0. Recap on Linear Models Formulation ####

# When we specify the Mean Structure using a Model Formula
# y (dependent variable) ~ x1 + x2 +... (mean structure of the model)
# (i.e. y = beta_0 + beta_1 * x1 + beta_2 * x2 + ... + eps )

# Operators used when specifying an R formula:
# + (Essential)                       Separates terms in the formula
# : (Essential)                       Separates predictors in interaction terms
# * (Non essential)                   Used to keep the formula short
# functions I() and update()          Used to keep the formula short

# y ~ x1                  # Univariate linear regression 
# formula(y ~ x1)         # ... equivalent specification

# y ~ 1 + x1              # Explicit indication for inclusion of an intercept (default)
# y ~ -1 + x1             # Exclusion of the intercept using term -1

# Employing nonessential operators
# y ~ f1*f2             means     y ~ f1 + f2 + f1:f2       # ANOVA with two-way interaction
# y ~ (f1+f2+f3)^2      means     y ~ f1 + f2 + f3 + 
#                                   f1:f2 + f1:f3 + f2:f3   # Up to 2nd order interactions

# Composite terms:
# -> Formulae syntax can be extended through mathematical functions, e.g.
# y ~ sqrt(x1) + x2     # Square root transformation of x1
# log(y) ~ x1 + x2      # log transform for y

# -> the functions I() and update():
# form2 = y ~ I(x1 + x2/100)   # I() function for to explicitate the arithmetic (vs default) meaning 
# update(form2, . ~ . + x3)    # x3 predictor added to form2
# update(form2, . ~ . -1)      # Intercept omitted from form2

### 1. Linear Models with homogeneous and independent errors ####
### we start by considering all observations as independent, with homogeneous variance

# LM: VISUAL_it = b_0t + b1 * VISUAL_0i + b_2t * TREAT_i + e_it

# b_0t, b_1, and b_2t denote the timepoint-specific intercept, 
# baseline visual acuity effect, and timepoint-specific treatment effect.
# Thus, the model assumes a time-dependent treatment effect,
# with the time variable being treated as a factor.

# To obtain timepoint-specific intercepts at 4,12,24 and 52 weeks, 
# the overall intercept is removed from the model by specifying the -1 term.

lm6.1 <- lm(visual ~ -1 + visual0 + time.f + treat.f:time.f, data = armd )
summary(lm6.1)

# variance-covariance matrix of Y  --> it is a diagonal matrix with a value of 12.38^2
par(mar = c(4,4,4,4))
plot(diag(x=12.38^2,nrow=12, ncol=12), main='Variance-covariance matrix of Y')

## residual analysis
plot(lm6.1$residuals) # they seem quite homoscedastic
abline(h=0)

qqnorm(lm6.1$residuals)
qqline(lm6.1$residuals)

shapiro.test(lm6.1$residuals)

## But we know that observations are not independent 
## and that the variance of the visual measurements increases in time

## let's color the residuals relative to different patients
colori =rainbow(length(unique(armd$subject)))
num_sub = table(armd$subject)
colori2 = rep(colori, num_sub)
plot(lm6.1$residuals, col=colori2)
abline(h=0)   ## --> not very informative

boxplot(lm6.1$residuals ~ armd$subject, col=colori,
        xlab='Subjects', ylab='Residuals', main ='Distribution of residuals across patients')  ## --> informative!

## let's color the residuals relative to different time instants
set.seed(1)
colori =rainbow(4)
colori2 = colori[armd$tp] # associate to each one of the 4 time instants a color
plot(lm6.1$residuals, col=colori2, ylab='residuals')
abline(h=0)
legend(650, -25, legend=c("time 4wks", "time 12wks", "time 24wks", "time 52wks"),
       col=colori, lty=1, cex=0.8)

## Note: we observe that red points are the closest to 0, purple ones are the farthest
## We expect the residuals to be heterogeneous across different time instants observations


boxplot(lm6.1$residuals ~ armd$time.f, col=colori,
        xlab='Time.f', ylab='Residuals')  ## -> the variance of th observations increases in time


# The model does not take into account the correlation 
# between the visual acuity observations obtained from the same subject. 
# It also does not take into account the heterogeneous variability
# present at different time points. Thus, it should not be used as a basis for inference.

### 2. Linear models with heteroscedastic and independent errors ####

## gls() function allows the inclusion of heteroscedasticity (and dependency)

##     data, 
##     subset,                           # optional
##     na.action,                        # optional
##     weights = varFunc(form=formula),  # Focus of 2.
##     control = glsControl()            # a list of control values to replace the default ones
##                                         e.g., for changing number of iterations, ...              
## )

## weights
## NB. The default value of the weights argument is NULL --> LM with homoscedastic residual errors
## weights can be given directly as a one-sided formula

## We know that variance increases in time --> we model the variance as a function of time
## We have different possibilities

## To formally test the hypothesis that the variances are timepoint specific,

#### 2.1 Option 3: VarPower() ####

## Residual analysis -- we assess the fit of the model using residual plots. 

## raw residuals 
plot(fm9.2, resid(., type = "response") ~ fitted(.)) # Raw vs. fitted
# We observe an asymmetric pattern, with large positive (negative) residuals 
# present mainly for small (large) fitted values.
# But it can be a consequence of the fact that raw residuals are intrinsically 
# heteroscedastic and correlated.

plot(fm9.2, resid(., type = "response") ~ time) # Raw vs. time (not shown)
bwplot(resid(fm9.2) ~ time.f, pch = "|", data = armd)
# The box-and-whiskers plots clearly show an increasing variance of the residuals.

## Pearson residuals [ ^eps_i/sqrt(Var(y_i)) ]
## Pearson residuals are obtained from the raw residuals by dividing the latter by an
## estimate of the appropriate residual standard deviation, so they should be more homoscedastic

plot(fm9.2, resid(., type = "pearson" ) ~ fitted(.)) # Pearson vs. fitted
plot(fm9.2,resid(., type = "pearson") ~ time) 
bwplot( resid(fm9.2, type = "pearson") ~ time.f, # Pearson vs. time.f
        pch = "|", data = armd)
## this plot illustrate the effect of scaling: the variance of the residuals is virtually constant.


##______________________________________________________________________________
### 3. Linear models with heteroscedastic and dependent errors ####

## We now modify the model, so that the visual acuity measurements,
## obtained for the same individual, are allowed to be correlated.

## We can estimate the semivariogram to calculate correlation coefficients between Pearson
## residuals for every pair of timepoints, separately. 

# The semivariogram function can be defined as the complement of the correlation function.

## Variogram per time difference (time = 4,12,24,52)
Vg1 <- Variogram(fm9.2, form = ~ time | subject)
Vg1
plot(Vg1, smooth = FALSE, xlab = "Time difference",ylim=c(0,0.7))

## Variogram per time lag (tp = 1,2,3,4), i.e., the absolute difference between two position indexes
Vg2 <- Variogram(fm9.2, form = ~tp | subject)
Vg2
plot(Vg2, smooth = FALSE, xlab = "Time Lag",ylim=c(0,0.7))

## From these two plots we see that correlation decreases with time lag/difference
## Therefore, a  correlation structure like, e.g., a compound symmetry, will most likely not fit the data well. 
## A more appropriate structure might be, e.g., an autoregressive process of order 1 AR(1). 

## Nevertheless, for illustrative purposes, we consider a model with a compound symmetry
## correlation structure.
